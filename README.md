# Communication_Simulation
This project was my 1st Homework for the course CMPE 160 (Introduction to Object Oriented Programming) at Bogazici University.
## About the Project
Since it was our first assignment regarding object oriented paradigm, assignment is straightforward but essential. I implemented a very basic version of communication simulation. The classes, methods and the input / output format is explained in detail (in the description). I followed object oriented design principles.
## To Run the Code
First compile using:
```javac CMPE160_HW1_volcaniqueo/src/question/*.java -d CMPE160_HW1_volcanique/bin```

Then move onto bin:
```cd CMPE160_HW1_volcaniqueo/bin```

Finally run using arguments:
```java question/Main <input_file> <output_file>```
